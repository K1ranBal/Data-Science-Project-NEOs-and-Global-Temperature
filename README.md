#Research Question
Are changes in global temperatures correlated with historical near-earth-object (NEO) impacts. Is there a relationship between the two? 

#Exec Summary
This research explores whether there is a relationship between NEOs and global temperature changes by using statistical methods; correlation, K-means and regression to analyse historic NEO characteristics and temperature reports. Initially no strong linear correlations were found which led to clustering NEOs based on characteristics; magnitude and distance from Earth, by using K-means. Although successful clustering was applied, the regression model produced a weak relationship, R2 = 0.17. Results suggest NEOs do not have a significant influence on climate changes, however further analysis can be conducted to improve the data, shedding more light on climate change and extraterrestrial influencers. 

#Introduction
Climate change is one of Earth’s largest concerns, with temperatures increasing by 1.36 degrees (2023) compared to the 19th century. Statistics show that the last 10 years have been the warmest recorded since 1884. (NASA, 2024). A study was done to determine the environmental perturbations caused by asteroid or comet impacts but what if we could determine these before impact?

NEOs have consequential impact on sudden climate change, with the latest technology available from NASA we can analyse predicted NEOs and their characteristics helping us identify impactful events and their potentially destructive effects like climate change – preparing us for the future.

If a relationship is determined, we can use the historical data to predict the impact on temperatures, based on the criteria of NEOs, we can use this prediction model to prepare for NEOs that impact Earth’s climate and mitigate earlier resulting in a safer future for mankind.
